           Raja Barley Biscuit Company was founded in 1926 by Thiru Sangupillai, a humble man who built his business not with financial backing or outside help, but with faith, discipline, honesty, and true friendship. With the support of his wife Chellamal, he began by making Soospori biscuits, also known as ghee biscuits, which he carried on his head and sold from shop to shop. His first store in Madurai was unsuccessful, leading him to Rajapalayam before returning once again to Madurai, where his biscuits finally found success. Inspired by his popularity in Rajapalayam, the company was named Raja Barley Biscuit Company. The journey was far from easy, with growth coming only after immense hardship and perseverance, but with the guidance and encouragement of his friend and guru, Guruvaraja, Sangupillai continued with determination.

         Thiru Maarimuthu, born in 1939, carried forward this legacy with equal dedication. In 1966, he introduced modern bakery practices by bringing the first bread-slicing machine to Madurai and later expanded the company with new equipment and over 20 varieties of biscuits and cakes, including the now-famous Paal Roti. He traveled widely across Europe, America, and Asia, studying global bakery practices and introducing international standards to his hometown. Known for his artistry in cake decoration as much as for his entrepreneurial spirit, he turned Raja Barley into a household name across Tamil Nadu.
